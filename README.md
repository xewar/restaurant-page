This is a simple restaurant website. The focus of the project was on using modules and webpack as part of my workflow. That part went well, but I'm still struggling with creating more responsive designs. 

Future updates:
+ Mobile compatibility: flexible sizing for the images.
+ Potentially add photos of the food to the menu page, with tabs for each menu section
+ Add an inquiry form to the contact/catering page.
